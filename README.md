# Etherea – The Living Operating System
Etherea is a next-generation adaptive digital ecosystem designed to sense the user’s focus, stress, and activity, then optimize the workspace in real time. It blends AI, cognitive ergonomics, affective computing, and human–computer interaction into a single intelligent environment that evolves with you.

---

## 🌱 Vision
Etherea’s vision is simple but bold:  
Technology should *feel alive*. An operating system should understand your mental state, reduce friction, and help you slip into deep flow. Etherea supports productivity, emotional well-being, and personalized work patterns by adapting to you instead of forcing you to adapt to it.

## ✨ Core Features
- **Adaptive Environment** — Interface shifts based on focus, workload, and emotional cues.  
- **Stress Detection** — Multimodal signals (typing patterns, pauses, interaction bursts, etc.) trigger calming modes.  
- **Focus Sensing** — Intelligently reduces distractions and reshapes your workspace depending on how “in the zone” you are.  
- **Productivity Engine** — Custom workspace layouts, smart task prioritization, and automation that learns your style.  
- **Cognitive Ergonomics Layer** — Interaction comfort, minimal cognitive load, and human-first design.  
- **Affective Computing Module** — Reads emotional context to personalize responses and environment settings.

## 🧠 System Architecture
- **Sensing Layer**  
  Collects subtle behavioral signals: typing speed, app usage, micro-pauses, context shifts.
- **AI Interpretation Layer**  
  Machine learning models decode patterns of focus, stress, and emotional state.
- **Adaptive Response Layer**  
  Dynamically adjusts notifications, UI layout, lighting themes, soundscapes, and more.
- **Feedback Loop**  
  Learns user patterns over time and refines model behavior.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React, HTML, CSS  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express  
- **AI Modules:** Python (planned)  
- **Database:** MongoDB  
- **Hosting:** Render / Vercel (deployment issues in progress)

---

## 📌 Goals
- Achieve stable deployment  
- Improve stress–focus detection accuracy  
- Expand adaptive UI behaviors  
- Integrate additional biometric and behavioral signals  
- Release developer API for extensions
